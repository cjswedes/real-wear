# Notes 4/6/19 Iteration 2

### Testing

This next section will touch on unit testing and acceptance testing. Whoever starts writing the code for frontend or backend, that person should write the unit test themselves as to avoid getting arbitrary unit tests done.

We should take testing a lot more seriously this iteration. 


### Shopping cart
Question: how do we pass the shopping cart info from frontend to backend?

We will make shopping cart calculations in frontend.


### Data from Professor

(See Ramsayquestionnaire.docx from slack)

The professor is sending a survey out to its student to act as 'guinea pigs' for customers for Ramsay.

We plan on giving the professor a deadline for giving us the data.
